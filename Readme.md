# Martin Neo/vim Config

This is a place where I put all of my (Neo)vim configuration. This will be a living repository as I learn more about being productive using (Neo)vim

## Install

Clone this repo! Clone to `~/.config/nvim`,
we'll also symlink it for Vim:

```sh
mkdir ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:martindavid/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/.config/nvim ~/.vim
```
