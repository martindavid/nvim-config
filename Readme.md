# Martin's Neo/vim Config

This is a place where I put all of my (Neo)vim configuration. This will be a living repository as I learn more about being productive using (Neo)vim

## Install

### Prerequisites

Before you clone the repo, make sure you have these two requirements installed:

- [shougo/dein.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- NodeJS (coc plugin will complain if there's no node installed)
- Python 3 and 2 with the latest `neovim` package installed. (This will be required by neovim)

Clone this repo! Clone to `~/.config/nvim`,
we'll also symlink it for Vim:

```sh
mkdir ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:martindavid/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/.config/nvim ~/.vim
```
